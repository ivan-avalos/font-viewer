# Font viewer

Font viewer is a tool that allows you to visualise easily your favourite fonts, allowing you to choose between Google fonts and system fonts, with the posibility to load custom ones from CDNs. You can also choose random fonts and many other interesting stuff.

## Configure

In order to be able to load fonts from Google Fonts, you need to create an API key from [here](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api) and set it into the `key` variable in `another.js` file.

```js
// +--------------------------------------+
// |  SET YOUR GOOGLE API KEY RIGHT HERE  |
// +--------------------------------------+
var key = 'AIza...';
```
